1.Rule 3 does not work properly as when I add a number rule 3 automatically becomes true where rule 3 is to check whether the password contains an uppercase character
2.If a rule N is not true then N+1 dissappears provided rule N+1 had been true in the past

Basically if a rule becomes true for the 1st time then the next rule should be displayed and if the same rule becomes false then it should not dissappear
As of now it does not follow this....: |
